# TGP-ST: Theory of Generated Space

This repository contains the working notes and preliminary formulations of the **Theory of Generated Space (TGP-ST)** — an original conceptual framework that explores a novel approach to unifying gravity and quantum mechanics.

## 🔬 Conceptual Status

**Disclaimer**: This is an evolving and exploratory project.  
The contents of this repository are **highly preliminary** and include **incomplete, speculative, and sometimes loosely defined ideas**.  
The goal is to develop the theory iteratively, much like a software project — hence the modular structure and ongoing commits.

## 🌌 Core Idea

The central hypothesis of TGP-ST is that **space is not a preexisting background**, but an **emergent, dynamic entity** generated locally by the presence of mass and energy. Instead of mass curving a static geometry (as in General Relativity), **space itself arises from matter**, and its "tension" is described by a scalar field Φ.

### Key assumptions:
- **No true vacuum**: even "empty" space is a state of fluctuating Φ, generated by quantum sources.
- **Φ as spatial density/tension**: determines the local structure and physical constants.
- **Dynamic constants**: the speed of light \( c \), Planck constant \( \hbar \), and gravitational constant \( G \) are functions of Φ.
- **Interference-based gravity**: gravitational effects arise from how locally generated space interacts and interferes between particles.
- **Inertia from geometry**: resistance to motion (mass) is a geometric effect — a consequence of modifying surrounding space.

## 🧭 Potential Research Directions

Some of the directions currently being explored:
- Interpretation of Φ as a **generalized Higgs field** — unifying mass generation and spacetime emergence.
- Reformulation of **E = mc²** in terms of \( c(Φ) \) and its implications for early-universe energy scales.
- Investigating **quantum-gravity dual limits** (N → ∞ and Φ → ∞) and the suppression of quantum effects.
- Exploring **observable predictions**, e.g. variable constants near massive bodies, quantum decoherence effects, or cosmological signatures.

## 📁 Structure

The repository will be expanded with modular `.tex` files, each dedicated to a specific concept or sub-theory:
- Core theory and formalism
- Φ-field dynamics and equations of motion
- Mass/inertia as geometric resistance
- TGP vs Higgs field
- Cosmological implications
- Experimental predictions
